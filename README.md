## Package Delivery Network System

The Package Delivery Network System is designed to optimize daily local delivery operations of a Parcel Service. This program utilizes a greedy nearest neighbor algorithm and custom hash table to ensure timely package deliveries within a constrained mileage.

## Features

- **Intelligent Routing Algorithm:** Incorporates a greedy nearest neighbor algorithm to determine the most efficient routes under 140 miles, ensuring all packages meet delivery deadlines.
- **Optimized for Scalability:** Designed to cater to the specific needs of Salt Lake City but easily adaptable for expansion to other cities.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an command line interface (CLI) for accessing delivery statuses at any times and total mileage, enhancing operational transparency and control.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For algorithm development and backend logic.

## Usage

- **View Package Status:** CLI prompts to check the delivery status, including delivery time, of any package by entering the package ID.
- **Monitor Delivery Progress:** Displays the total mileage traveled by all trucks and prompts to track the progress of deliveries throughout the day by entering a specific time.
